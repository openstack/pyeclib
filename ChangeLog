 * Fix some requirements and installation instruction.


New in 1.2.1
------------

 * Eliminate spurious syslog messages and added cleaner
   mechanism for querying all available backends on a system.

 * Moved source code hosting from bitbucket to Openstack infra.
   This is first release with Openstack Infra

New in 1.2.0
------------

 * Remove integrated liberasurecode - the prereq library is now 
   available in major deb/rpm based distros

 * Eliminate liberasurecode-related rpath checks, library searches
   and architecture validation

 * Changes for compatibility with liberasurecode versions prior to
   1.1.0

 * Make VALID_EC_TYPES a runtime property - dynamically look for 
   liberasurecode EC schemes available at runtime

 * More comprehensive unit test coverage 

 * Add travis-ci build config for automated build/tests

New in 1.1.0
------------

 * Eliminate pyeclib dependency on alloc functions internal to
   liberasurecode

 * Update include subdirs to be explicit

 * Update internal liberasurecode version to 1.1.0

New in 1.0.9
------------

 * Eliminate rpath handling in setup.py

 * Clean py34 shared libraries created during build

 * Fix integer truncation issue with PyBuildValue on Big Endian
   systems by explicitly casting the size argument passed in to
   Py_ssize_t.  Also fix import issue with the API test where
   older versions of Python fail to import.

 * Add --install-liberasurecode option to setup.py.  Requested
   by Red Hat/Debian package maintainers.

 * Update bundled liberasurecode version to 1.0.9


New in 1.0.8
------------

 * Support for a new Reed-Soloman backend (liberasurecode_rs_vand)
   - naive, non-accelerated version, native to liberasurecode

 * Single version, with liberasurecode distributed in the package,
   installed if necessary.  No versions going forward with Jerasure
   included.  Use 'liberasurecode_rs_vand' for default test backend.

 * Test code refactor for eliminating duplicated code, add cases
   for liberasurecode_rs_vand and making jerasure/isa_l test cases
   conditional.

 * Better Python3 support

 * setup.py enhancements
   - improved library path detection on Mac OS X (and Linux) including
     workarounds for Mac OS X dyld bugs for library search paths
   - handling installroot better for optional liberasurecode installs

 * tox support for automated py27 and py34 testing
