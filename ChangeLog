 * Eliminate liberasurecode-related rpath checks, library searches
   and architecture validation

 * Changes for compatibility with liberasurecode versions prior to
   1.1.0

 * Make VALID_EC_TYPES a runtime property - dynamically look for 
   liberasurecode EC schemes available at runtime

 * More comprehensive unit test coverage 

 * Add travis-ci build config for automated build/tests

 * Eliminate rpath handling in setup.py

 * Clean py34 shared libraries created during build

   conditional.

 * Better Python3 support

 * setup.py enhancements
   - improved library path detection on Mac OS X (and Linux) including
     workarounds for Mac OS X dyld bugs for library search paths
